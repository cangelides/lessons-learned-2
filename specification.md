#Software Specification and Connextra#

Before this class, I thought specifying software entailed mostly creating a long list of requirements to hand over to the dev team to run with.   But that approach leaves much to be desired—especially when it comes to defining the user experience, which is probably the key factor for the success of any project.  

This class provided us a strong framework and some hands-on tools to better articulate to dev teams the end product that’s being sought.   The framework is simple for a manager specifying software: (1) lay out the vision; (2) identify the target audience; and (3) define the jobs that need to be done.  

**The Vision:** Communicating a vision early on in a project is the critical first step.  Analogies (it’s like…, it’s not like…), prototypes, pictures, and text descriptions are a few ways of providing some more detail to dev teams in a clear, understandable way.

**The Audience:** Knowing who your audience is and/or selecting the target audience will provide additional assistance in specifying the software that’s needed.  Eight to ten short interviews (approx. 30 min), focus groups, analysis of user feedback, market analysis, etc. can help managers to better understand the audience’s needs and incorporate those insights into the software specification process.

**The Job:**  Thinking of software in terms of the jobs that need to be done for the specific audience(s) is the final component.  This involves thinking about the user experience and the benefits that features will provide end users.

##Hands-on Tools: Connextra##
Probably the most helpful tool for implementing this framework that was discussed in class is the Connextra model, which breaks the software specification process down into a series of epics and user stories.  

**User Story:**

As a **ROLE** (e.g., visitor, customer, administrator)
I want **FEATURE** (e.g., product search, shopping cart)
So that **BENEFIT** (e.g., saves time, inventory management)

The value of this approach in specifying software is that it allows managers to focus on identifying the potential users of the software, the core elements of their experience and the benefits that the users are seeking, without being over prescriptive of the software design.   This gives developers flexibility and freedom to create and design features for the appropriate users to achieve the benefits they desire.

##Business Case Example:##
I was really excited to test out the Connextra model to help solve a current business problem my organization faces.  I manage a team of policy advocates and campaign organizers who are working to build relationships with clean energy businesses and engage them in state and federal energy policy issues.  One of the key challenges we face is that we don’t have an effective contact management database to log key information about the businesses we are building relationships with (contact names, addresses, employment information, etc), our interactions with them, and other related data.  We know that we don’t want to build our own solution and have been looking to purchase a software package like Salesforce.  Unfortunately, the hangup has been that we aren’t  totally clear on what our needs are and as a result how to evaluate the different options out there in the market.   

Using the Connextra model, my team and I set aside a lunch meeting to develop a series of epics and user stories to outline who would be potentially using the database, the features we desired, and the benefits we hoped those features would provide.  We used colorful sticknotes on a white board so that we could organize the user stories into epics/themes.  A few examples are shown below.  

**ORGANIZER/ADVOCATE**
**FILTER BUSINESSES BY LOCATION**
**ENGAGE BUSINESSES IN OUR LOCAL EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES**

**DEVELOPMENT/FUNDRAISER**
**FILTER BUSINESESSES BY LOCATION**
**INVITE BUSINESS LEADERS TO RELEVANT FUNDRAISERS**

**ORGANIZER/ADVOCATE**
**VIEW INTERACTION HISTORY WITH BUSINESS**
**IMPROVE ENGAGEMENT/AVOID OVERCONTACTING**

**ORGANIZER/ADVOCATE**
**VIEW NOTES FROM INTERACTION HISTORY**
**IMPROVE CONTINUITY OF OUTREACH**

**ORGANIZER/ADVOCATE**
**VIEW AREAS OF INTEREST FOR BUSINESS CONTACT**
**TARGET ENGAGEMENT REQUESTS**

The process helped us tp develop a much more comprehensive understanding of the internal users that would be using the product and the features and benefits that the product needed to provide.  We’re now working on prioritizing the most important features and benefits and developing a survey based on the user stories to gain additional feedback from across different users in the organization before we research and evaluate how different software products stack up and ultimately choose one.
